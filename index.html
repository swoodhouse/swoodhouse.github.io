  <h1>Steven Woodhouse</h1>
  <p>My name is Steven Woodhouse and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, in <a href="https://camara-lab.org/">Pablo CÃ¡mara's lab</a>.</p>
  <p>Before UPenn I worked at Microsoft Research as a postdoc for two years with Jasmin Fisher. I received my PhD in Haematology at the University of Cambridge under Bertie Gottgens, where I developed an algorithm for synthesising executable regulatory models from single cell gene expression data and applied it to the study of embryonic blood development. Before that I studied for my MPhil in computational biology at the University of Cambridge, and my BSc in computer science from Newcastle University.</p>
  <p>My research interests are in using computational approaches to improve regenerative medicine and immunotherapy. At UPenn I am currently working on characterising and optimising chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, and on developmental gene regulatory networks. I am also currently working on applications of game theory to cancer evolution and targeted therapy.</p>
  <p>I also have a strong interest in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithms for seemingly intractable combinatorial problems.</p>
