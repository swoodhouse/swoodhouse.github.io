  <h1>Steven Woodhouse</h1>
  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p>My name is Steven Woodhouse and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, in <a href="https://camara-lab.org/">Pablo CÃ¡mara's lab</a>.</p>
  <p>Before UPenn I worked at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/t-stwood/">Microsoft Research</a> as a postdoc for two years with <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cancer/research/department-pathology/computational-cancer-biology">Jasmin Fisher</a>. I received my PhD in Haematology at the University of Cambridge under <a href="https://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk/research/affiliated/gottgens">Bertie Gottgens</a>, where I developed an algorithm for synthesising executable regulatory models from single cell gene expression data and applied it to the study of embryonic blood development. Before that I studied for my MPhil in computational biology at the University of Cambridge, and my BSc in computer science from Newcastle University.</p>
  <h2>Research interests</h2>
  <p>My research interests are in using computational approaches to improve regenerative medicine and immunotherapy. At UPenn I am currently working on characterising and optimising chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, and on developmental gene regulatory networks. I am also currently working on applications of game theory to cancer evolution and targeted therapy.</p>
  <p>I also have a strong interest in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithms for seemingly intractable combinatorial problems.</p>
  <h2>Publications</h2>
  <p>My publications can be found on my <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=RtaI3XUAAAAJ">Google scholar profile</a>.</p>
  <h2>Current Projects</h2>
  <h3>Characterisation of CAR T cell therapy</h3>
  <p>At Penn with Pablo Camara and Jos Melenhorst, and in collaboration with the Rong Fan lab at Yale I am working on characterising CAR T cell therapy using single-cell RNA-seq.</p>
  <h3>Executable Gene Regulatory Network Synthesis</h3>
  <p>During my PhD at Cambridge I developed an algorithm for the synthesis of mechanistic, executable gene regulatory networks from single-cell gene expression data. With Bertie Gottgens, Jasmin Fisher and Nir Piterman I applied this algorithm to the study of blood development in the mouse embryo. At Penn with Pablo Camara I am adapting this method to modern scRNA-seq data, using methods from topological data analysis.</p>
  <h3>Applications of Game Theory to Cancer Evolution and Targeted Therapy</h3>
  <p>In collaboration with Matthew Clarke, Nir Piterman and Jasmin Fisher, I am applying ideas from computational game theory to the problem of cancer evolution and therapy resistance.</p>
